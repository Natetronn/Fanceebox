Read this "article":http://nicolasbottari.com/blog/decorate_your_custom_field_labels_in_expressionengine/ for a bit more context on adding html to your field labels.

You can add links to images, galleries and websites directly within your publish/edit page. These can be external or internal

h2. To Do Thoughts

* Would be nice to setup this up in such a way to allow the editing of the fancybox options. Currenlty any adjustments have to be made manually in the fanceebox.js file. This would probably have to turn into an extension.
